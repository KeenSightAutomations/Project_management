## **ðŸ“Š Quarterly ROI Reporting**

This workflow automatically runs every quarter and generates a comprehensive report summarizing ROI performance for all completed projects. The report includes key insights such as the average ROI, ROI comparisons by project type, and identification of the top 10% highest and lowest ROI projects.

### **Workflow Steps**:
1. **Trigger: Scheduled Run**  
   The workflow is scheduled  to run at the end of each quarter. The trigger initiates the process of analyzing all projects marked as `Completed` in Airtable.

2. **Fetch Completed Projects**  
   The Airtable node retrieves all records where `Completion Status = "Completed"`. Key project details, such as `Project Name`, `Revenue Generated`, `Actual Costs`, `Project Type`, and `Client Name`, are fetched.

3. **Aggregate ROI Data**  
   Using a Code node, the workflow calculates:
   - **Average ROI:** Computes the average ROI across all completed projects.
   - **ROI by Project Type:** Groups projects by their `Project Type` and calculates the average ROI for each category.
   - **Top 10% Highest and Lowest ROI Projects:** Identifies the top 10% most and least profitable projects.

4. **Generate Airtable Report**  
   The aggregated insights are written back into Airtable, creating a detailed quarterly ROI report for easy reference and decision-making.
