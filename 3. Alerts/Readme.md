# **Alert System Workflow Documentation**

This workflow automates alerts based on project ROI and budget data in Airtable. By identifying projects with low ROI, high ROI, and recurring expense overages, the system provides actionable insights for project managers to optimize profitability and budgeting strategies.

## **ðŸ“Š Alert System Details**

This workflow monitors projects in Airtable and triggers alerts for specific scenarios, enabling project managers to take proactive steps to improve project performance and control costs.

### **Workflow Scenarios**:
1. **Low ROI Projects**  
   Projects with an ROI below a defined threshold (e.g., 10%) are flagged, and an alert is sent with detailed cost analysis and suggestions for improvement.

2. **High ROI Projects**  
   Projects with an ROI above a defined threshold (e.g., 50%) are highlighted as examples of successful strategies. Recommendations for replicating these strategies in future projects are provided.

3. **Recurring Expense Overages**  
   Projects that repeatedly exceed their budget are flagged, and the system suggests conducting an analysis review to adjust future budgeting expectations.

## **Benefits of the Workflow**

1. **Proactive Cost Management**  
   Alerts enable project managers to address cost inefficiencies before they escalate.
2. **Performance Optimization**  
   Identifies high ROI projects to replicate success and low ROI projects for improvement.
3. **Efficient Budgeting**  
   Helps refine budget allocations based on historical overage patterns.
